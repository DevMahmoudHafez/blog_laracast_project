## Further Ideas
Of course we only had time in the Laravel From Scratch series to review the essentials of a blogging platform. You can certainly take this many steps further. Here are some quick ideas that you might play with.

- Add a status column to the posts table to allow for posts that are still in a "draft" state. Only when this status is changed to "published" should they show up in the blog feed.
- Update the "Edit Post" page in the admin section to allow for changing the author of a post.
- Add an RSS feed that lists all posts in chronological order.
- Record/Track and display the "views_count" for each post.
- Allow registered users to "follow" certain authors. When they publish a new post, an email should be delivered to all followers.
- Allow registered users to "bookmark" certain posts that they enjoyed. Then display their bookmarks in a corresponding settings page.
- Add an account page to update your username and upload an avatar for your profile.
